# DCHMI-template

This is a template that was specifically designed to help students of the Digitising Cultural Heritage Materials (DCHM) course at the University of BorÃ¥s publish their digitisation projects online with GitHub Pages. 
But it can be used by anyone who wants to try GitHub Pages to publishing a simple HTML-based website.

ðŸš€[Visit the Website](https://woutdln.github.io/DCHM-template/) if you want to see what the published version of this repository looks like.

An example of what the template can turn into can be found in Wout's [DIY-frankensTEIn](https://woutdln.github.io/DIY-frankensTEIn/index.html) repository.
For more information on the template and how to get started yourself, please refer to [the repository's wiki](https://github.com/WoutDLN/DCHM-template/wiki).
